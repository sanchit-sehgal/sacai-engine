## EUNN Structures

EUNN, or Efficiently Updatable Neural Network, is an architecture that aims to replace the traditional alpha-beta pruning evaluation form that was commonplace in strong chess engines several years ago. Since then, many of the world's strongest chess engines (including Stockfish and lc0) have since added Neural Network evaluation to their computations. SACAI uses the lc0 neural networks to evaluate many board positions, allowing it to evaluate previously-seen positions in a much more efficient manner.
